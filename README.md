# pcars2-udp2csv
Ingest UDP stream from Project Cars 2 and write data to CSV file for data visualization

## Introduction

Started playing Project Cars 2 in December 2017 and learned about the UDP stream offering.  After studying the fantastic work of [James Remuscat](https://github.com/jamesremuscat) and his github project called [pcars](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/pcars), I decided to write some code.  I didnt fork the repository, but I did use the code in lots of ways and learned a bunch about handling UDP packets and binary operations in Python.  So my personal thanks and gratitude for his work on this technology.

There were several goals for this.
* Improve Python skills
* Create a way to perform data visualizations using Google Sheets and/or Pandas dataframes
* Do something meaningful with lots of network traffic
* Improve PC2 skills or car setups using data collected from this scanner
